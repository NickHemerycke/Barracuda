so currently we can return a value but we can't get the if logic yet to work
This is quite frustrating as this is already way more complex then i imagined
it's fun though can't wait till i get to play around with wasm


so currently my nested logic is broken down and i'm not smart enough to figure this out so ive asked ai 
and figure this it aint smart enough either so i guess its my job afterall
